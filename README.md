Living Cookbook Rescue Downloads

This program will read a Living Cookbook 2015 backup file (.lcb) and output your recipes to Living Cookbook .fdx export files which can be imported into other recipe software. Alternatively, you can chose to write your recipes to formatted Microsoft Word documents (.docx) with customizable styles or plain text files (.txt).
This program is designed to help those who have Living Cookbook backup files, but can no longer run the program because of license key issues.
